      no_default_handlers: |
        In Lita 5.0, the default handlers were moved to a separate gem called lita-default-handlers.
        Lita 5 has a hard dependency on this gem, so all the default handlers will continue to load
        by default. However, in Lita 6.0, the default handlers will only be loaded if you explicitly
        include the gem in your Lita project's Gemfile. You can do this now by adding the following
        line to your Lita project's Gemfile:

          gem "lita-default-handlers"
